This is my first bigger project - snake game made in C#, using Visual Studio 2026 WPF framework. >>[Go to latest release](https://github.com/Nightlite185/Snake-Game/releases/tag/v1.0)<<

I intentionally didn't use any boilerplate-reducing libraries for the sake of learning MVVM conventions and how it works internally, since its my first MVVM app.
