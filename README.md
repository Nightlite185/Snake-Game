This is my first bigger project - snake game made in C#, using Visual Studio 2026 WPF framework. >>[Download here](https://github.com/Nightlite185/Snake-Game/releases/download/beta/SnakeGame.zip)<<

I intentionally didn't use any boilerplate-reducing libraries for the sake of learning MVVM conventions and how it works internally, since its my first MVVM app.
